# nosql-challenge
 
The Resources folder contains establishments.json, these are that data that were used in the setup and analysis. For both parts, I used the starter code provided. NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb has the code for the first part of the assignment and NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb has the code for the second part of the assignment. I have made notes in places where I had to look up commands from elsewhere.
